* Remaining Options to implement for Stewart pipeline
** DONE irk_representation
*** DONE differential
*** DONE differential_lift_x
** DONE irk_scheme
*** DONE Cases where c_n != 1
** lift_complementarities
Maybe this is not actually necessary anymore? IMO no as solver handles this.
** DONE g_path_at_fe
** DONE g_path_at_stg
** DONE x_box_at_fe
** DONE x_box_at_stg
** DONE time_optimal_problem
** DONE equidistant_control_grid
** DONE relax_terminal_constraint
** DONE relax_terminal_constraint_from_above 
Do we actually need this?
** relax_terminal_constraint_homotopy
How do we allow people to tie into the homotopy in `mpccsol`
** DONE relax_terminal_numerical_time
** relax_terminal_physical_time
Will be done when time-freezing is implemented
** DONE cost_integration
** DONE least squares costs
** DONE g_path_comp
** DONE step_equilibration
* General improvements 
** Fix the spagghetti that is the time handling code
Currently the code that handles the constraints for time are _incredibly_ hard to parse and therefore almost certainly very error prone. 
Due to this we should figure out a way to simplify them and not have the time-freezing reformulation leaking into the dicrete_problem.
* Other Features left to implement
** DONE integrator
